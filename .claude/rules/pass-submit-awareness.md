# Call vs Submit Awareness in Passes

> **Status:** `Submit` is a first-class IR kind sibling to `Call`, representing
> a task launch from `pl.submit(...)` inside a `pl.manual_scope`. If the kind
> has not yet landed in the codebase you are reading, treat this rule as the
> required handling once it does — and treat any current attrs-based encoding
> (e.g. `Call::attrs_["manual_dep_edges"]`, return-type augmentation with
> `Scalar[TASK_ID]`) with the same "submit-aware" diligence in the interim.

## Core Principle

**PyPTO has two call-like Expr kinds: `Call` (plain function call) and `Submit`
(task launch). When you create or modify a pass that inspects calls, you MUST
consider both — never assume `Call` covers all call-like nodes.**

This is the same shape of issue as `Var` / `IterArg` covered in
`ir-kind-traits.md`: a single `ObjectKind` dispatch will silently skip submits,
and the bug only surfaces inside `pl.manual_scope` bodies.

## What Distinguishes Submit from Call

| Aspect | `Call` | `Submit` |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Semantics | Synchronous function call | Asynchronous task launch |
| Where it appears | Anywhere | Inside `manual_scope` bodies |
| Return type | Callee's declared return | `Tuple[<callee return>..., Scalar[TASK_ID]]` |
| `args_` vs callee `params_` | Identity, full coverage: `args_.size() == params_.size()` | Identity, *bounded*: `args_.size() <= params_.size()` (see rule 5) |
| Has `deps` | No | First-class `deps_` field — TaskId `Var`s / `Array`s |
| Use-def chain | `args_` only | `args_` **and** `deps_` |
| Python syntax | `out = self.foo(...)` | `out, tid = pl.submit(self.foo, ...)` |

## What Pass Authors Must Do

### 1. When walking calls, walk Submit too

```cpp
// ❌ Silently skips submits — bug inside manual_scope
void MyPass::VisitExpr_(const CallPtr& op) {
  for (const auto& arg : op->args()) { Visit(arg); }
}

// ✅ Handle both — visitor dispatches on kind
void MyPass::VisitExpr_(const CallPtr& op)   { VisitCallLike(op); }
void MyPass::VisitExpr_(const SubmitPtr& op) { VisitCallLike(op); }

void MyPass::VisitCallLike(const ExprPtr& op) {
  auto view = AsCallLike(op);              // unified accessor
  for (const auto& arg : view.args()) Visit(arg);
  for (const auto& dep : view.deps()) Visit(dep);  // empty for Call
}
```

### 2. Treat `deps_` as part of the use-def chain

A `Submit::deps_` entry is a TaskId `Var` or `Array` — a real SSA value, not
metadata. Passes that:

- Collect uses → must include `deps_`
- Substitute variables → must rewrite `deps_` too
- Validate SSA dominance → must check `deps_` are defined before the `Submit`
- Run DCE / liveness → TaskId vars are live through `deps_`

```cpp
// ❌ Missing deps_ — TaskId vars look unused, may get DCE'd
std::vector<VarPtr> CollectUses(const SubmitPtr& op) {
  return CollectVarUses(op->args());
}

// ✅ Submit uses include deps_
std::vector<VarPtr> CollectUses(const SubmitPtr& op) {
  auto uses = CollectVarUses(op->args());
  for (const auto& dep : op->deps()) AppendVarUses(&uses, dep);
  return uses;
}
```

### 3. When transforming, preserve Submit-ness

A pass that rewrites a `Submit` must produce another `Submit`, not a plain
`Call` — even if `deps_` becomes empty after the rewrite. The `TASK_ID` return
shape and the structural property "submit appears inside manual_scope" must be
preserved.

```cpp
// ❌ Loses the Submit kind — return type no longer matches the binding LHS
auto new_call = std::make_shared<Call>(op->callee(), new_args, ...);

// ✅ Preserve kind through rewrite
auto new_submit = std::make_shared<Submit>(
    op->callee(), new_args, op->deps(), op->return_type(), op->span());
```

### 4. When examining return types

`Submit`'s return type is **always** augmented with `Scalar[TASK_ID]` at the
tail. If your pass inspects return types of call-like nodes (for tuple
projection, type inference, etc.), strip / account for the trailing `TASK_ID`
before comparing against the callee's declared signature.

### 5. When matching `args_` against callee `params_`

**Canonical statement: `Submit::args_` in `include/pypto/ir/expr.h`.** Read it
there — this is the pass-author summary, not a second source of truth.

`Call` maps by identity (`args_[i]` ↔ `params_[i]`) with full coverage.
`Submit` has **bounded** coverage (`args_.size() <= params_.size()`), and
identity holds only over the leading caller-supplied args. With
`gap = params_.size() - args_.size()` and `ctx` = number of trailing
`CommCtxType` params, a Submit's args split into three regions:

| Callee param indices | In `args_`? | Notes |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| `[0, args_.size() - ctx)` | Yes, at `args_[i]` | **Any** direction — In / InOut / **and Out** |
| `[args_.size() - ctx, params_.size() - ctx)` | No — the gap | Runtime-allocated; must be declared `Out` |
| `[params_.size() - ctx, params_.size())` | Yes, at `args_[i - gap]` | CommCtx suffix; `MaterializeDistTensorCtx` grows signature and call site together |

Easy to get wrong:

- **Caller-allocated `Out` params are NOT excluded from `args_`.** Coverage is
  bounded, not direction-filtered.
- **`args_[i] ↔ params_[i]` breaks once `gap > 0` and `ctx > 0` coexist.** For
  params `[x, omitted_out, ctx]` the args are `[x, ctx]`, so `args_[1]` binds
  `params_[2]`, and indexing `param_directions_` by arg index is wrong.
  `DeriveCallDirections` is safe only by ordering: pass 37 runs before
  `MaterializeDistTensorCtx` (43) makes `ctx` non-zero.
- **The gap comes from user source, not a pass.** `pl.submit(self.kernel, x)`
  against a kernel declaring a trailing `pl.Out` parses fine and carries the
  gap through the pipeline, so bailing on `!=` mishandles ordinary DSL input.
  (No pass opens it: `ConvertTensorToTileOps` and `InjectGMPipeBuffer` both
  forward the arg they append.)

This does **not** change the return shape (rule 4): an appended `Out` param
mirrors an existing declared return, so caller- and runtime-allocated params
surface through the *same* return-tuple elements — only the alias target differs.

**Orchestration codegen:** `TaskOutputTensors` holds only runtime-created
outputs, so aliasing a tuple-return element must dispatch on region —
caller-supplied → the arg's emit name; runtime-allocated →
`task_<n>_outs.get_ref(param_idx - (args_.size() - ctx))`. Details on
`Submit::args_`.

A pass that hard-codes `args_.size() == params_.size()` silently bails on
Submit and leaves attrs empty. Use a kind-aware bound:

```cpp
// ❌ Wrong for Submit — bails whenever the callee has uncovered params
if (call->args_.size() != callee->params_.size()) return call;

// ✅ Relax the size check for Submit, keep it exact for Call.
const bool size_ok = is_submit ? (call->args_.size() <= callee->params_.size())
                               : (call->args_.size() == callee->params_.size());
if (!size_ok) return call;
// Valid only while gap == 0 or ctx == 0; after MaterializeDistTensorCtx a
// pass must map suffix args by `i + gap`.
for (size_t i = 0; i < call->args_.size(); ++i) { auto dir = callee->param_directions_[i]; ... }
```

Route gap params through `add_output`, not args-indexed code. A
`SubmitToCallView`-style adapter does **not** fix this: `args_` is copied
through unchanged.

### 6. Verifier hooks

If a pass produces a new IR property that involves `Submit` (e.g. "all submit
dependencies are dominated by their definitions"), add a `SubmitVerifier` and
register it in the `PropertyVerifierRegistry` — same pattern as other
property verifiers (see `pass-context-config.md` and `documentation.md`).

## Decision Guide: Unified vs Separate Handlers

```text
Does the pass treat Call and Submit identically?
├─ YES → Use AsCallLike() / a shared VisitCallLike helper — one code path
│
└─ NO  → Submit needs special handling (visits deps_, checks scope, etc.)
    └─ Override VisitExpr_(CallPtr) and VisitExpr_(SubmitPtr) separately
```

When in doubt, separate handlers are safer — the unified `CallLike` view is an
optimization for passes that genuinely do not care about deps or task-launch
semantics.

## Audit Checklist

Before merging a new or updated pass that touches calls, verify:

- [ ] If the pass inspects `Call`, it also inspects `Submit` (or uses `CallLike`)
- [ ] If the pass collects variable uses, `Submit::deps_` is included
- [ ] If the pass rewrites or clones calls, Submit-ness is preserved
- [ ] If the pass examines call return types, the `TASK_ID` suffix on `Submit` is accounted for
- [ ] If the pass matches `args_` against callee `params_`, it allows the Submit coverage bound (size_ok = `args_.size() <= params_.size()`, not `==`) and does not assume Out params are absent from `args_`
- [ ] If the pass produces a structural invariant, the verifier covers `Submit` too
- [ ] Tests cover at least one `pl.manual_scope` / `pl.submit` case if the pass is reachable from there
