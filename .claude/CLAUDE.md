# AI Assistant Rules for PyPTO Project

Please follow the following rules when working on the PyPTO project:

## Project Rules

All rules for this project are located in the `.claude/rules/` directory. Please read and follow all applicable rules from that directory when:

- Making code changes
- Reviewing code
- Committing changes
- Working across different layers (C++, Python, etc.)

Refer to the individual rule files in `.claude/rules/` for specific guidance on project conventions, coding standards, and best practices.

## Machine-Local Resource Limits

Before compiling or running tests, source
`.claude/skills/testing/load-env.sh`. Always pass the resulting
`PYPTO_BUILD_JOBS` or `PYPTO_TEST_JOBS` explicitly; never use bare
`--parallel`, `-j`, or pytest `-n auto`. The loader reads the ignored
machine-local `testing.env` from the primary checkout, including when invoked
from a linked worktree, and defaults unclassified machines to two jobs. These
limits override conflicting command examples elsewhere, including the root
`AGENTS.md` preferred commands.

## Skills (`.claude/skills/`)

Skills are workflow guides that help the main assistant perform specific tasks:

Portable shared skills are published as plugins from
`hw-native-sys/pypto-skills`; PyPTO-specific skills remain repository-local.
Install the shared plugins needed for the current agent and scenario:

```bash
# Codex
codex plugin marketplace add hw-native-sys/pypto-skills
codex plugin add pypto-developer@pypto-skills
codex plugin add pypto-user@pypto-skills

# Claude Code
claude plugin marketplace add hw-native-sys/pypto-skills
claude plugin install pypto-developer@pypto-skills
claude plugin install pypto-user@pypto-skills
```

- **`git-commit`** - Complete commit workflow with review, testing, and optional code simplification
- **`code-review`** - Reviews code changes against project standards (`context: fork` — runs in isolated context)
- **`testing`** - Builds project and runs test suite (`context: fork` — runs in isolated context)
- **`github-pr`** - Creates a GitHub pull request after committing and pushing
- **`create-issue`** - Creates a GitHub issue following project templates
- **`fix-issue`** - Fixes a GitHub issue by fetching, branching, planning, and implementing
- **`fix-pr`** - Fixes PR issues: addresses review comments and resolves CI failures
- **`clean-branches`** - Removes stale local and remote fork branches that have been merged into main
- **`compare-codegen`** - Compares codegen output (.pto files, pass dumps) between origin/main and current branch for a given test case
- **`generate-ir-trace`** - Runs a PyPTO or pypto-lib case, or converts an existing pass dump, into a validated self-contained IR lowering trace HTML report
- **`incore-profiling`** - Profiles generated kernels with the Ascend op simulator and exports per-kernel traces
- **`weekly-changelog`** - Generates a weekly markdown changelog summarizing external API/feature changes from git commits in a date range, with before/after Python examples and author attribution

`git-commit`, `github-pr`, `create-issue`, `fix-issue`, `fix-pr`,
`clean-branches`, and `auto-pr` come from `pypto-developer`.
`generate-ir-trace` and `incore-profiling` come from `pypto-user`.

**Key advantage:** `code-review` and `testing` use `context: fork` to run in isolated subagent contexts. They can run in parallel during commit workflows without polluting the main context window.
