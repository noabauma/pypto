/**
 * @file legalize_graph_boundary_pass.cpp
 * @brief Make every FunctionType::Graph function legal to record and replay.
 *
 * The host_build_graph runtime records a Graph function's task topology on the
 * first call and replays it afterwards, patching only buffer addresses and
 * boundary scalars. Three classes of problem follow from that, and this pass
 * exists to catch all three at compile time:
 *
 * **Step A — derived boundary scalars (silent wrong answers).** A boundary
 * scalar is tracked by *pointer identity*: the runtime anchors the address of
 * each `args.scalar(k)` slot during recording and re-reads it on replay. A value
 * the body *derives* from a scalar parameter (`base = layer * 5120`) has no such
 * slot, so it is classified as static data and frozen at its first-call value —
 * with no warning on any later replay. Step A hoists those computations to the
 * call sites, where they become ordinary pass-through scalars.
 *
 * Being frozen is only a *problem* when the value can differ between calls, so
 * what Step A cannot hoist is not automatically illegal. A value that is the
 * same on every replay — a constant-trip loop's induction variable, a boundary
 * tensor's own extent — is left where it is and accepted, because the frozen
 * copy is the correct one. `graph_replay::ReplayInvariantSet` draws that line;
 * the class comment there explains why it is strictly weaker than hoistability.
 *
 * **Step C — region allocations (unbounded memory).** A `tensor.create` inside
 * the region records a kernel-less `alloc_tensors` node, so it replays
 * correctly — but the buffer comes off the graph heap, which `task_allocator.h`
 * never reclaims mid-run. The live set then grows with the number of
 * submissions rather than staying flat: a decoder layer holding 14 intermediates
 * costs 14 x N over N recorded layers. Step C moves each one to the call site as
 * an `InOut` boundary tensor, which is what simpler's hand-written
 * `qwen3_14b_decode` scene does by hand and for the same stated reason.
 *
 * **Step D — boundary legality (silent fallback).** Almost every other runtime
 * constraint degrades to a silent non-graph fallback in a release build: the
 * program is correct but the feature does nothing, which no numerical test can
 * detect. Step D checks the statically decidable ones and fails loudly instead.
 *
 * Runs after DeriveCallDirections and AutoDeriveTaskDependencies (so argument
 * directions and cross-task edges are known) and before MaterializeRuntimeScopes
 * (so scopes are not yet materialised around the statements it moves).
