/// CanonicalizeTileSlice
/// ---------------------
/// Lowers a ``tile.slice`` into the canonical ``tile.extract`` form so that
/// movement is unified on ``pto.textract`` — Mat-resident slices (folded into
/// matmul / ``tile.extract`` consumers), Vec slices that need materialization
/// for ``tile.col_expand_*`` (#1640, #2010), and Vec slices whose byte address
/// is not provably 32-byte aligned (#1789).
///
/// A ``tile.slice`` whose result tile is ``Mem.Mat`` is a legal high-level
/// "sub-window of a Mat tile" construct — ``FlattenTileNdTo2D`` emits one per
/// batch page when it unrolls a ``tile.batch_matmul`` (the page offset is
/// ``batch_index * page_rows``; for a leading-dim-1 batch the offset is 0 and
/// the window covers the whole tile, but it is still a ``tile.slice``).
/// PTO ISA supports ``pto.subview`` on Mat as a zero-copy alias (no data
/// movement), but a standalone Mat slice followed by a consumer that triggers
/// lazy materialization would attempt a ``loc=mat -> loc=mat``
/// ``pto.textract`` — an unsupported L1→L1 DMA path.
///
/// This pass eliminates Mat-resident ``tile.slice`` nodes whose consumers it
/// can canonicalize by folding the offset into each consumer:
///
///   * Consumed by ``tile.extract(s, ir, ic, shape)`` — the extract reads the
///     slice's source directly and the slice offset is added into ``ir`` /
///     ``ic``:
///         extract(slice(src, _, [or, oc]), ir, ic, shape)
///       == extract(src, ir + or, ic + oc, shape)
///
///   * Consumed by a ``tile.matmul`` / ``tile.matmul_acc`` / ``tile.matmul_bias``
///     operand — the operand is replaced by a fresh
///     ``tile.extract(src, or, oc, shape, target_memory=Left|Right)`` (Left for
///     the lhs operand, Right for the rhs).  This is the same Mat->Left/Right
///     extract that ``AutoTileMatmulL0`` emits for tiled matmuls.
///
/// It also canonicalizes a **Vec** ``tile.slice`` consumed by the
/// ``tile.col_expand_*`` family (issues #1640, #2010).  Those ops cannot read a
/// ``pto.subview`` operand, so codegen lazily materializes the slice via
/// ``pto.textract`` into the slice's own result buffer — and because
/// ``tile.slice`` inherits its source's memory, that buffer sits *inside the
/// still-live source*.  The extract is therefore performed in place over its own
/// input, which is safe only when it is an identity copy.  Two things must hold:
///
///   * the destination **address** must be right — a const offset is folded into
///     ``base + off``, but a dynamic one cannot be encoded as a ``ConstInt``
///     address and falls back to the bare source base, so the extracted window
///     lands on the source's row 0 (#1640);
///   * the destination **layout** must match — the slice buffer is dense (row
///     pitch = slice cols) while the source window is strided (row pitch = base
///     cols).  These coincide only for a *contiguous* window: a single row, or a
///     window spanning every column.  A column slice of a multi-row tile
///     (``t[:, a:b]``) repacks strided -> dense on top of its own source and
///     destroys it — only row 0 survives, since its dense destination happens to
///     equal its source address (#2010).
///
/// Whenever either condition fails, the operand is replaced by a fresh
/// ``tile.extract(src, or, oc, shape, target_memory=Vec)`` — whose result gets
/// its own non-inherited allocation — which removes the aliasing.  An
/// identity-copy slice is left untouched so it keeps sharing the source buffer.
///
/// Finally, PTO vector instructions require their tile operands' base addresses
/// to be 32-byte aligned.  A zero-copy Vec subview inherits
/// ``base + (row * base_cols + col) * storage_bits``; a column slice such as
/// ``fp32_tile[:, 1:2]`` therefore starts four bytes past an aligned allocation.
/// For every ordinary consumer of such a slice, this pass inserts a fresh Vec
/// ``tile.extract``.  The extract result has its own aligned allocation, while
/// slices whose offset is provably aligned remain zero-copy. Dynamic offsets
/// are handled conservatively, but scalar SSA arithmetic can prove alignment:
/// a dynamic row is safe when its known multiple times the base row stride is
/// aligned, and a dynamic column is safe when its known multiple times the
/// element storage width is aligned.
/// Last, the pass **rejects** the col-major (``Acc`` / L0C) dual of the #2010
/// contiguity condition when the slice is a matmul *accumulator*.  Here there is
/// no repair to apply — an ``Acc`` window cannot be copied out and back, because
/// nothing in the memory graph points into ``Acc`` — so the only correct
/// response is a diagnostic.  In L0C's NZ layout block ``(r_b, c_b)`` of an
/// ``[M, N]`` tile sits at ``(c_b * M/16 + r_b) * fractal``, so a window is
/// contiguous only when it spans the parent's full row extent or occupies a
/// single 16-column block.  A row slice of a multi-block-column accumulator is
/// therefore strided, and the MAD cannot express a destination stride: pto-isa's
/// ``TMATMUL_ACC_IMPL`` forwards the destination as a bare ``.data()`` pointer
/// and derives ``m`` from the *left operand*, so ``TileRes::Rows`` — the only
/// carrier of the parent stride — is discarded at the intrinsic boundary.  ptoas
/// preserves it faithfully up to that point (``getSubviewPhysicalType`` keeps the
/// parent shape and narrows via ``valid``); the information is lost in the last
/// call.  Without this guard the kernel silently computes wrong results, with
/// only the first 16 columns of each row tile correct.
///
/// Tracked upstream as hw-native-sys/pto-isa#253.  **This guard is scoped to
/// that defect, not to a property of the DSL** — a row window of an ``Acc`` tile
/// is a legitimate thing to write, and the IR expresses it correctly all the way
/// down.  If pto-isa gains a destination stride (or otherwise passes
/// ``TileRes::Rows`` into ``mad``), the shape becomes representable and this
/// rejection must be relaxed or deleted, not kept as a permanent DSL rule.
///
/// The window an accumulator operand names is rarely the ``tile.slice`` result
/// Var itself.  Hoisting the slice out of the K loop — the natural spelling,
/// since the window does not change per K step — turns the in-body operand into
/// a loop ``IterArg``; a shape-preserving ``tile.reshape`` of the window is
/// another SSA name for the same bytes.  ``SliceCollector`` therefore records a
/// window not only for the slice result but for every Var reached from it along
/// an *identity-preserving* edge (see ``SliceCollector::BindWindowAlias``), so
/// the guard's lookup answers "which window does this operand name", not "is
/// this operand a slice".  Widening that reach must never widen what the guard
/// *rejects*: an edge is recorded only when both ends provably describe the same
/// window extent, and anything unproven is left unrecorded — which reproduces
/// the pre-existing silence rather than guessing.
///
/// A loop's *back* edge is the one place a single Var names two different
/// windows — the initializer's on iteration 0, the yielded one afterwards — so
/// it is checked rather than recorded, and only when the loop provably runs more
/// than once (``SliceCollector::ResolveLoopEdges``).
///
/// **This guard can reject a shape the compiler itself emitted**, so the
/// diagnostic below must explain a window the user may never have written.
/// ``FlattenTileNdTo2D`` used to be the source of exactly that: it stacked the
/// pages of a batched accumulator along rows, so a ``tile.batch_matmul_acc``
/// wider than 16 columns produced the rejected window with no ``tile.slice`` in
/// the kernel source.  It now packs those pages along *columns* — the accepted
/// full-row-extent shape — and reports the batch shapes it cannot pack with its
/// own diagnostic, so that lowering no longer reaches here.  The rejection stays
/// as the backstop for any future pass that re-introduces a strided accumulator
/// destination.
///
/// After all consumers are rewritten the now-dead ``tile.slice`` is dropped.
/// Chained slices (a slice of a slice) are peeled, accumulating the offset.
///
/// Pipeline position: right after ``AutoTileMatmulL0`` (so the per-iter
/// ``tile.extract``s that read the batch-page slices already exist) and before
/// ``InferTileMemorySpace``.
