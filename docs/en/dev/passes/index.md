# Passes

Every transformation PyPTO runs over the IR, numbered to match its position in the
default pipeline.

Pass documentation is numbered so that reading it front to back walks the
compilation pipeline in execution order. `01`–`43` are pipeline passes; `91`+ is
reserved for passes that run at several positions and for infrastructure that is not
a pipeline pass at all.
