# LowerHostTensorCollectives Pass

## Overview

`LowerHostTensorCollectives` rewrites host-orchestrator calls to
`pld.tensor.allreduce`, `pld.tensor.barrier`, `pld.tensor.broadcast`,
`pld.tensor.reduce_scatter`, `pld.tensor.allgather`, and
`pld.tensor.all_to_all` into compiler-internal
builtin chip dispatches. It runs
after [`MaterializeCommDomainScopes`](39-materialize_comm_domain_scopes.md), so
each window-bound data tensor and explicit or synthesized signal tensor already has a
`WindowBuffer` back-reference and belongs to an inferred communication domain.

The pass does not change non-host functions. InCore allreduce calls continue to
use [`LowerCompositeOps`](12-lower_composite_ops.md).

## Position in the pipeline

```text
... -> SynthesizeAllReduceSignals -> MaterializeCommDomainScopes -> LowerHostTensorCollectives -> MaterializeDistTensorCtx -> Simplify (final) -> MaterializeRuntimeScopes
```

The final `Simplify` runs after this pass so any generated loop bounds or
constant expressions can still be folded before runtime scopes are inserted.

## Behavior

For a host-orchestrator call:

```python
data = pld.tensor.allreduce(data, signal, op=pld.ReduceOp.Sum)
data = pld.tensor.allreduce(data, signal, op=pld.ReduceOp.Sum, mode="ring")
signal = pld.tensor.barrier(signal)
data = pld.tensor.broadcast(data, signal, root=0)
data = pld.tensor.reduce_scatter(data, signal, op=pld.ReduceOp.Sum)
data = pld.tensor.allgather(stage, data, signal)
data = pld.tensor.all_to_all(stage, data, signal)
```

`pld.tensor.allreduce` dispatches on its `mode` kwarg: the default
`mode="mesh"` lowers to `builtin.tensor.allreduce`, while `mode="ring"` lowers
to `builtin.tensor.allreduce_ring`. Any other value is rejected as a user
error.

For `allgather` / `all_to_all`, `stage` (TPUT source) and `data` (result)
must be two distinct windows. For `allgather` the `stage` window holds only
this rank's single chunk and is `[1, SIZE]`; for `all_to_all` it carries one
per-destination chunk per row and is `[NR, SIZE]`. In both cases `data` is the
`[NR, SIZE]` result window peers push into.

The pass emits the corresponding `builtin.tensor.*` dispatch per participating
device (including `builtin.tensor.allreduce` /
`builtin.tensor.allreduce_ring`, `builtin.tensor.barrier`,
`builtin.tensor.broadcast`, `builtin.tensor.reduce_scatter`,
`builtin.tensor.allgather`, and `builtin.tensor.all_to_all`). When the
surrounding comm-domain scope has an explicit device list, the pass emits a
`SeqStmts`; otherwise it emits a sequential `for r in
pld.system.world_size()` loop.

Each generated builtin call carries the collective-specific args and kwarg
attributes from the source `pld.tensor.*` call.  Window-bound INOUT tensors
are threaded through as-is; scalar kwarg values (`op`, `root`, `dtype`) are
forwarded to the builtin.

Assignments preserve the user-facing rebind idiom by appending
`<result> = <original expr>` after the generated builtin calls.

## Checks

The pass requires both args to be materialized `DistributedTensorType` views in
the same `CommDomainScopeStmt`. The host allreduce builtin supports
`ReduceOp.Sum`, `Max`, `Min`, and `Prod` over FP16 or FP32 data and arbitrary
positive element counts. It processes 256-element chunks and rounds ragged FP16
and FP32 load spans to 32 bytes without changing the logical tensor shape.
Its INT32 signal tensor may be rank-1 `[world_size]` or rank-2
`[world_size, 1]`, with enough static capacity when the participating device
count is statically known. Ring allreduce (`mode="ring"`) uses a rank-2 signal shaped
`[2 * (NR - 1) + 1, NR]`, whose `shape[0]` must equal `2 * (NR - 1) + 1` when both
signal dimensions are compile-time constants, and must be at least
`2 * (NR - 1) + 1` when only `shape[0]` is statically known (no static check when
both dims are dynamic). When the participating device count is statically known, the signal
must have enough static capacity. Ring allreduce additionally requires `numel(src) % NR == 0`
(the ring schedule partitions src into NR contiguous chunks; a non-zero remainder would leave a
trailing partial chunk the kernel cannot handle). The host-ring `src` shape must be
statically known — dynamic extents are rejected, since the kernel would otherwise silently
return unreduced data when the runtime `numel` is not divisible by `NR`.

Ring allreduce currently supports only `ReduceOp.Sum` with `dtype=FP32`.
`ReduceOp.Max`, `ReduceOp.Min`, `ReduceOp.Prod`, and `FP16` are not yet available
with `mode="ring"`. Ring allreduce also supports at most 16 participating
devices (`world_size <= 16`).
