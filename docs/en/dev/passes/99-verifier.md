# IR Verifier

Extensible verification system for validating PyPTO IR correctness through pluggable property verifiers with diagnostic reporting and Pass integration.

## Overview

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **PropertyVerifier (C++)** | Base class for verification rules |
| **PropertyVerifierRegistry (C++)** | Singleton mapping IRProperty → PropertyVerifier factories with verify/report API |
| **Diagnostic** | Structured error/warning report with severity, location, and message |
| **VerificationError** | Exception thrown when verification fails |

### Key Features

- **Pluggable Rule System**: Extend with custom verification rules
- **Property-Based Verification**: Opt-in property sets — verify exactly what you need
- **Structural Properties**: TypeChecked, BreakContinueValid, NoRedundantBlocks, UseAfterDef, OutParamNotShadowed, NoNestedInCore, InOutUseValid, PipelineLoopValid, ArrayNotEscaped, ManualDepsOnSubmitOnly, and AtomicAddDtypeValid are verified before/after each pass by `VerificationInstrument`; at pipeline start `PassPipeline` verifies only the lightweight subset shared with `GetVerifiedProperties()`
- **Dual Verification Modes**: Collect diagnostics or throw on first error
- **Pass Integration**: Use as a Pass in optimization pipelines
- **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Collect all issues with source locations

## Architecture

### Structural vs Pipeline Properties

| Category | Examples | Behavior |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Structural** | TypeChecked, BreakContinueValid, NoRedundantBlocks, UseAfterDef, OutParamNotShadowed, NoNestedInCore, InOutUseValid, PipelineLoopValid, ArrayNotEscaped, ManualDepsOnSubmitOnly, AtomicAddDtypeValid | Always true. Verified before/after each pass by `VerificationInstrument`; the subset shared with `GetVerifiedProperties()` is also checked at pipeline start. Never in PassProperties. |
| **Pipeline** | SSAForm, NoNestedCalls, HasMemRefs, ... | Produced/invalidated by passes. Verified per pass-declared contracts. |

`GetStructuralProperties()` returns `{TypeChecked, BreakContinueValid, NoRedundantBlocks, UseAfterDef, OutParamNotShadowed, NoNestedInCore, InOutUseValid, PipelineLoopValid, ArrayNotEscaped, ManualDepsOnSubmitOnly, AtomicAddDtypeValid}`. These are verified **before/after each pass** by `VerificationInstrument`. At **pipeline start**, `PassPipeline::Run()` verifies only the lightweight subset shared with `GetVerifiedProperties()` (`GetStructuralProperties().Intersection(GetVerifiedProperties())`) — so e.g. `ArrayNotEscaped` is checked before/after each pass but not at pipeline start. Since no pass declares them in `required`/`produced`/`invalidated`, `VerificationInstrument` unions them with the pass's declared properties to ensure no pass breaks these fundamental invariants.

### Verification Rule System

The verifier uses a **plugin architecture** where each `PropertyVerifier` subclass is an independent rule:

- Rules run in registration order across all functions
- Each rule operates independently — one rule's failure doesn't affect others
- Rules receive `ProgramPtr` and internally decide whether to iterate over functions or check program-level properties
- Rules can be selectively included via `IRPropertySet`

### Diagnostic System

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| ----- | ---- | ------- |
| `severity` | `DiagnosticSeverity` | Error or Warning |
| `rule_name` | `string` | Which rule detected the issue |
| `error_code` | `int` | Numeric error identifier |
| `message` | `string` | Human-readable description |
| `span` | `Span` | Source location information |

### Integration with Pass System

1. **Automatic property verification**: `PassPipeline` uses `PropertyVerifierRegistry` to check produced properties after each pass (controlled by `VerificationLevel` in `PassContext`). The lightweight subset of structural properties shared with `GetVerifiedProperties()` is checked at pipeline start. See [Pass Manager](00-pass_manager.md).
2. **`VerificationInstrument`**: A `PassInstrument` that verifies properties via `PassContext`. Before each pass, it checks the pass's declared `required` properties. After each pass, it checks the pass's declared `produced` properties **plus all structural properties** — ensuring no pass breaks fundamental IR invariants.

The `run_verifier()` utility creates a standalone `Pass` for ad-hoc use in custom pipelines, but it is **not** part of the default optimization strategies.

## Built-in Rules

| Rule Name | IRProperty | Purpose |
| --------- | ---------- | ------- |
| **SSAVerify** | SSAForm | No multiple assignment, no name shadowing, no missing yield, scope violations, cardinality checks |
| **TypeCheck** | TypeChecked | Type kind/dtype/shape/size consistency |
| **NoNestedCall** | NoNestedCalls | No nested call expressions in args, conditions, ranges |
| **BreakContinueCheck** | BreakContinueValid | Break/continue only in sequential/while loops |
| **UseAfterDefCheck** | UseAfterDef | Every Var use dominated by a definition (param, AssignStmt, loop var, iter_arg, return_var) |
| **NormalizedStmtStructure** | NormalizedStmtStructure | Nested `SeqStmts` flattened and single-child `SeqStmts` unwrapped |
| **NoRedundantBlocks** | NoRedundantBlocks | No single-child or nested `SeqStmts` |
| **SplitIncoreOrch** | SplitIncoreOrch | No `InCoreScopeStmt` nodes remain in Opaque functions |
| **IncoreTileOps** | IncoreTileOps | InCore functions use tile ops (no tensor-level ops remain) |
| **HasMemRefs** | HasMemRefs | All TileType variables have MemRef initialized |
| **AllocatedMemoryAddr** | AllocatedMemoryAddr | All MemRefs have valid addresses within buffer limits |
| **OutParamNotShadowed** | OutParamNotShadowed | Out/InOut params not reassigned with tensor-creating ops |
| **NoNestedInCore** | NoNestedInCore | No nested InCore scopes (`InCoreScopeStmt` inside `InCoreScopeStmt`) |
| **InOutUseValid** | InOutUseValid | Variables passed as InOut/Out to user-function calls are not read after the call (RFC #1026). Group-typed function bodies are skipped pending follow-up. |
| **PipelineLoopValid** | PipelineLoopValid | Bidirectional invariant on every `ForStmt`: `kind_ == ForKind::Pipeline` ⇔ `pipeline_stages` attr present. Either direction failing means the pipeline loop is malformed. |
| **ArrayNotEscaped** | ArrayNotEscaped | No `ArrayType` appears as a function parameter or return type (checked transitively through `TupleType`). `ArrayType` is on-core scalar-register-file / C-stack storage owned by the enclosing function — letting it cross a function boundary would leak a stack pointer, so it must be created and used locally inside the function body. |
| **ManualDepsOnSubmitOnly** | ManualDepsOnSubmitOnly | No plain cross-function `Call` (GlobalVar callee) carries `attrs["manual_dep_edges"]` — manual dependency edges live in the typed `Submit::deps_` field. Op calls (`system.task_dummy`) keep the attr as their codegen fanin contract and are exempt. |
| **OrchestrationReferencesResolved** | OrchestrationReferencesResolved | Every non-builtin Call inside a `FunctionType::Orchestration` function targets a Function that exists in the surrounding Program. Replaces the codegen-side `ValidateOrchestrationReferences` walk that used to throw at codegen time. |
| **RuntimeScopesMaterialized** | RuntimeScopesMaterialized | Every `FunctionType::Orchestration` function has `attrs_["auto_scope"] == false`, the marker stamped by `MaterializeRuntimeScopes` once explicit `RuntimeScopeStmt` nodes are in place (or set by user `@pl.function(auto_scope=False)`). Orchestration codegen emits `PTO2_SCOPE()` only from those nodes; skipping the pass leaves `auto_scope=True` and would silently omit scopes. **Produced by** `MaterializeRuntimeScopes` and listed in `GetVerifiedProperties()`, so `PassPipeline` auto-verifies it after that pass. |
| **AssignTypeSymmetry** | AssignTypeSymmetry | Every `AssignStmt(var, value)` satisfies `structural_equal(var.type, value.type)`. Covers dtype, shape, and tile_view/tensor_view; additionally TileType `memory_space` (TensorType has no `memory_space`) and DistributedTensorType `window_buffer`; tuple-typed assignments compare every element recursively. `memref_` is **excluded** — `structural_equal` treats it as an allocation detail bound to the Var, governed by `HasMemRefs` / `AllocatedMemoryAddr`. Catches passes that mutate one side of an assignment without the other (e.g. #1262 TileType memory_space, #1278 tile_view). Registered in `PropertyVerifierRegistry` but not yet in `GetStructuralProperties()` — run on demand via `PropertyVerifierRegistry::verify` or by adding the property to a `VerificationInstrument`. |
| **AivSplitValid** | AivSplitValid | Structural checks on the first-class `SplitAivScopeStmt` region, keyed on the node itself (so nested / multi-mode functions are checked region by region). A function holding at least one region opts into **manual mode**, where the regions are authoritative for vector placement. **(a)** No cube compute inside **any** region — for two independent reasons, which is why it fires whatever the mode: a data-parallel region cannot vector-split a `matmul` (each AIV lane holds only half the tile), and every region, task-parallel included, *is* the AIV lane's body, where cube work does not belong. **(b)** No vector reduce (`tile.row_*` / `tile.col_*` / `tile.sum` / `tile.max` / `tile.min`) that collapses the **split axis** — it yields a partial per-lane result (a miscompile). Unlike (a), this reasoning is split-axis-specific, so (b) stays gated on the data-parallel modes. **(c)** `aiv_shard` / `aic_gather` must appear inside a region (both the `tile.*` and author-facing `tensor.*` forms). Inside a task-parallel `mode=NONE` region they are **accepted**: with no split axis they still carry the meaning checks (f)/(g) demand — this value crosses the AIC/AIV boundary — and their `split=0` deduction preserves the shape instead of halving or re-joining it. **(d)** The **boundary memory contract**: `tile.aiv_shard` is `Acc → Vec` and `tile.aic_gather` is `Vec → Mat`. Both ops *are* the cross-core transfer, so the operand must live on the producing lane and the result on the consuming one; the memory sides are skipped until resolved, so the same check is safe across the whole window. Mode-independent — a task-parallel crossing spans the same two lanes as a data-parallel one — so it runs in every region, `NONE` included. **(e)** No VECTOR-affine op **outside** every region in a manual-mode function — with the region authoritative for placement, such an op is neither pinned to the AIV lane nor cube work, so it has no defined home. Three carve-outs: `tile.load` / `tile.store` are the compiler's own out-of-region output, since `ConvertTensorToTileOps` hoists the load/store pair for a tensor-level op out of the region holding the compute it feeds; and an op that **declares** its lane via `set_core_affinity` (`system.syncall(core_type="aiv_only")`, `system.sync_set/sync_wait(core_type="aiv")`, `pld.tile.put` / `get`) was never inferred in the first place, so a region cannot disambiguate it. A function with **no** region is unaffected. **(f)** V->C: a value defined inside a region and read on the **cube** lane outside it must be a `tile.aic_gather` result. **(g)** C->V: a cube-produced value defined outside every region and read on the **vector** lane inside one must arrive through a `tile.aiv_shard`. Both directions already lower without the op — the compiler emits a `split=0` tpush/tpop pair either way — which is exactly why they are checked: manual mode exists so the author, not the compiler, places the AIC/AIV boundary, and a boundary nobody wrote is one nobody chose. (f)/(g) share (e)'s `tile.load` / `tile.store` carve-out on **both** the definer and the consumer side, for the same reason: the compiler hoists that pair out of the region itself. A cross-C/V `tile.move` counts as a consumer on the side it delivers to, so the checks stay live at the `InferTileMemorySpace` verification point, where an implicit crossing has become such a move. **Not checked, deliberately:** the lane rule for a V->C crossing out of a `mode=NONE` region — the ISA requires both AIV sub-lanes to take part in a no-split handshake and they share one destination slot with no per-lane offset, and nothing arbitrates between them, so when the lanes hold different values the cube receives an unspecified one of the two; keeping the gathered value lane-uniform is the author's job, and is documented rather than synthesized. Also lane-sharding of a once-only side effect (`pld.system.notify`). A region cannot mean "exactly once" — the AIV function carries `dual_aiv_dispatch`, so its body runs on both AIV sub-lanes — and the correct authoring form (sharded by `aiv_id`) and the incorrect one (both lanes notifying the same peer) are structurally identical IR. Both rules are stated for authors in [Scopes and Placement](../../user/language/04-scopes.md) instead. **(h)** **Placement** — `pl.split_aiv` opens a CORE_GROUP-level region, so it must be authored inside a CORE_GROUP scope (`pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP)`) or at the top of an Opaque function (which the parser wraps into exactly such a scope) — never inside a function already declared `pl.FunctionType.InCore`. Keyed on **provenance**: a region reaches an InCore function legitimately only when `OutlineIncoreScopes` lifted the enclosing CORE_GROUP scope into it, which the outliner records by stamping `split_aiv` on the function it mints (`scope_outline_utils.h`; `LowerAutoVectorSplit` re-stamps it). So the check is "InCore function carrying a region, but not one the outliner produced". Provenance rather than shape is what makes it survive the parser emitting a top-level region **bare** in an InCore function — which it must, so that printing an outlined function and reparsing it rebuilds the same IR. A shape-based test ("region nested in a surviving InCore scope") worked only while the parser wrapped every top-level region, and would have silently stopped rejecting anything once it stopped. `LowerAutoVectorSplit` keeps its own post-lowering guard as the backstop for scope kinds this check does not walk; reporting here puts the diagnostic 12 passes closer to the source. **Produced by** `OutlineIncoreScopes`, then invalidated-and-re-produced by `ConvertTensorToTileOps` and `InferTileMemorySpace`, and finally invalidated by `LowerAutoVectorSplit` (which erases the region node). `PassPipeline` only verifies *produced* properties (`passes.cpp`), so those re-productions are what give checks (d) and (e) a live verification point — at `OutlineIncoreScopes` the boundary is still the space-less `tensor.*` form (so (d) is inert) and tensor-level compute classifies `SHARED`, which leaves (e), (f) and (g) with no VECTOR or CUBE op to find. Checked ops are plain `Call`s with a non-null `op_`; `Submit`s are correctly skipped. **Fix**: (a) move the cube op outside the region; (b) reduce the non-split axis, or `tile.aic_gather` the lanes back first; (c) move the boundary op inside the region it belongs to; (d) shard only a cube-produced value — a vector-produced one (`pl.load` / `pl.full`) is already on the AIV lane, so drop the `pl.aiv_shard` and let the implicit affinity-gated split halve it; (e) wrap that phase in its own region — `for _ in pl.split_aiv(2, mode=pl.SplitMode.NONE):` runs the full body on both lanes and is the task-parallel form for full-width compute; (f) gather the value inside the region (`x = pl.aic_gather(x)`) and read the gathered one outside; (g) read it as `pl.aiv_shard(x)` at the top of the region. |
| **HardSyncallOccupancy** | HardSyncallOccupancyValid | A hard (FFTS) `system.syncall` waits for **every** physical core of its `core_type` to reach the barrier, so the enclosing SPMD launch must satisfy two independent guarantees: (1) **full occupancy** — fill all those cores exactly (`N != required` → error, covering both partial and over-occupancy); and (2) **`sync_start=True`** — all blocks co-resident at once, since a non-sync_start launch may dispatch blocks in waves and deadlock the barrier even at full occupancy. Either gap deadlocks on device (AICore timeout 507018) and leaves it needing a reset. **Produced by** `ExpandMixedKernel` (which resolves each launched kernel's `FunctionType` — the precondition the check needs) and listed in `GetVerifiedProperties()`, so `PassPipeline` auto-verifies it right after that pass. Covers every SPMD launch site whose block count it can classify — a `FunctionType::Spmd` function (scope `pl.spmd`), a `FunctionType::Group` function with a `core_num` attr (`pl.cluster()`-nested `pl.spmd`), and a `Submit` with `core_num` (`pl.spmd_submit`). A width is either a compile-time literal (checked against the SoC's physical counts) or a **launch-shape query** — `pl.system.available_cluster_count()` / `pl.system.available_aiv_count()`, directly or through the Var it binds. A query resolves on device to the run's own geometry, so it fills its core type by construction and needs no count comparison; it is also the portable spelling, since a literal matching this SoC is wrong on any run whose device reports a different usable count — too few blocks when more cores are available, too many when fewer are (which the runtime rejects outright). Using the query for the *other* core type (an AIV-only launch sized by the cluster count, or a mixed launch sized by the AIV count) is rejected. Per launch site and its direct callee: standalone **AIV** kernel + `aiv_only` → `required = GetCoreCount(VECTOR)`; standalone **AIC** kernel + `aic_only` → `required = GetCoreCount(CUBE)`; a standalone AIV/AIC kernel with a *mismatched* `core_type` (incl. the default `mix`) is rejected outright — the other core type has zero participants in a single-core launch, so the barrier can never complete; **Group** (mixed kernel) → `required = GetCoreCount(CUBE)` core-groups (one AIC per group, filling all cores) for any barrier `core_type`, checking the hard syncalls in its AIC/AIV sub-kernels (duplicated `mix` reported once). Skipped when the backend is unconfigured, `core_num` is neither a literal nor a launch-shape query, or no SPMD site launches the kernel (occupancy is a launch-time property). **Fix**: launch at full occupancy with a matching `core_type` and `sync_start=True` — preferably by sizing the launch with the matching launch-shape query — or use `pl.system.syncall(mode="soft", ...)` (GM-polling) for partial occupancy. |
| **AccToGmStoreValid** | AccToGmStoreValid | Every `tile.store` whose source tile is **Acc-resident** targets a GM tensor whose dtype the cube fix-pipe can narrow into: `INT32/FP32/FP16/BF16` on both Ascend910B and Ascend950 (`BackendHandler::SupportsAccToGmDtype`, mirroring pto-isa's non-quant `CheckAcc2gm` whitelist and ptoas' `pto.tstore` "acc tstore dst element type" rule; the hook stays per-backend because the two sets are independent facts about each pinned target). An `INT8`/`INT16` destination is rejected. **Produced by** `InferTileMemorySpace` and listed in `GetVerifiedProperties()`, so `PassPipeline` auto-verifies it right after that pass. That placement is load-bearing: legality is a property of the tile's **memory space**, not of the user-visible dtypes, so it cannot be decided earlier — the identical DSL program is legal when its matmul result routes through Vec (an explicit `pl.cast` narrows in the vector unit) and illegal when it stays in Acc. Without this check the program reaches ptoas, which rejects it at `pto.tstore` verification against a line in a generated `.pto`; one such store also tends to trip a second, unrelated-looking op (an int8 zero-init lowers to a `pto.texpands` with the same illegal dtype), so the late diagnostic names two symptoms and never the cause. Skipped when the backend is unconfigured (nothing to verify against) or the tile's memory space is unresolved. **Fix**: narrow through the vector unit — `pl.cast` the matmul result to the destination dtype and store that — or accumulate into an `INT32`/`FP32` tensor and convert afterwards. |
| **AtomicAddDtypeValid** | AtomicAddDtypeValid | Every atomic-add write into global memory targets a destination dtype the backend's store pipe can combine. Covers every atomic site in one place: `tile.store`, `tensor.assemble`, `pld.tensor.put`, `pld.tile.put`, `pld.tensor.remote_store` and `pld.tile.remote_store`. Only `bf16` varies by backend — pto-isa lowers it to `SetAtomicAdd<bfloat16_t>` -> `set_atomic_bf16`, honoured on Ascend910B (A2/A3) and not on Ascend950 (A5) (`BackendHandler::SupportsBf16AtomicAdd`); the remaining hardware atomic-add dtypes (`FP32/FP16/INT32/INT16/INT8`) are accepted everywhere and gated backend-neutrally in the op deducers. The remote-put path is the *same* mechanism as the local store, not a parallel one: pto-isa's comm `TPut` streams the transfer through its VEC staging tile and lands each chunk with `TSTORE_IMPL<..., AtomicAdd>`, and `remote_store` emits a `pto.tstore` directly, so one predicate governs every site — and ptoas carries no atomic dtype rule of its own (`TPutOp::verify` checks element-type agreement and shapes only), so without this check the program reaches a pto-isa `static_assert` in generated code the user never wrote. Listed in **`GetStructuralProperties()`**, not produced by any pass: nothing here depends on lowering (the atomic kwarg and the destination dtype are present in the user's own IR), so `PassPipeline` verifies it at `pipeline_input` and the error carries the original `Span`. Skipped when the backend is unconfigured (nothing to verify against). **Fix**: accumulate into an `FP32` tensor and cast to `bf16` after the reduction. |

**Scoping rules:**

- Function parameters are in scope for the entire function body
- `AssignStmt`: LHS variable enters scope after RHS is evaluated
- `ForStmt`: `loop_var` and `iter_args` are in scope inside the loop body only; `return_vars` enter the enclosing scope after the loop
- `WhileStmt`: `iter_args` are in scope for the condition and body; `return_vars` enter the enclosing scope after the loop
- `IfStmt`:
  - **SSA / phi-node form (`return_vars_` present)**: definitions inside then/else branches do **not** propagate to the outer scope; only `return_vars` enter the enclosing scope after the `if`
  - **Non-SSA "leak" form (`return_vars_` absent)**: branch-local definitions may be visible after the `if`; `ConvertToSSA` and `SSAVerify` are responsible for validating the resulting form

## Usage Examples

### Basic Verification

```python
from pypto.pypto_core import passes

# Verify default properties
props = passes.get_default_verify_properties()
diagnostics = passes.PropertyVerifierRegistry.verify(props, program)

if diagnostics:
    report = passes.PropertyVerifierRegistry.generate_report(diagnostics)
    print(report)
```

### Selective Verification

```python
# Verify only specific properties
props = passes.IRPropertySet()
props.insert(passes.IRProperty.SSAForm)
props.insert(passes.IRProperty.TypeChecked)
diagnostics = passes.PropertyVerifierRegistry.verify(props, program)
```

### Disabling Checks

```python
# Start from default set and remove what you don't want
props = passes.get_default_verify_properties()
props.remove(passes.IRProperty.SSAForm)
diagnostics = passes.PropertyVerifierRegistry.verify(props, program)
```

### Error Handling with Exceptions

```python
props = passes.get_default_verify_properties()
try:
    passes.PropertyVerifierRegistry.verify_or_throw(props, program)
    print("Program is valid")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Verification failed: {e}")
```

### Using in a Custom Pipeline

```python
# Create verifier pass (defaults to get_default_verify_properties())
verify_pass = passes.run_verifier()
result = verify_pass(program)

# Or with custom properties
props = passes.get_default_verify_properties()
props.remove(passes.IRProperty.SSAForm)
verify_pass = passes.run_verifier(properties=props)
result = verify_pass(program)
```

## Adding Custom Rules

### Implementation Steps

1. Inherit from `PropertyVerifier`, implement `GetName()` and `Verify()`
2. Create a factory function returning `PropertyVerifierPtr`
3. Register with `PropertyVerifierRegistry` in the constructor
4. Add Python binding and type stub (optional)

### Guidelines

- Use `IRVisitor` to traverse IR nodes systematically
- Keep rules focused — one rule checks one category of issues
- Avoid side effects — only read IR and write diagnostics
- Create descriptive diagnostics with severity, rule name, error code, message, and span

## Related Components

- **Pass System** (`00-pass_manager.md`): Verifier integrates as a Pass, PropertyVerifierRegistry used by PassPipeline
- **IRBuilder** (`../ir/06-builder.md`): Construct IR that verifier validates
- **Type System** (`../ir/02-types.md`): TypeCheck rule validates against type system
- **Error Handling** (`../02-error-handling.md`): Exception hierarchy, assertion macros (`CHECK`, `INTERNAL_CHECK_SPAN`), and `Diagnostic` / `VerificationError` definitions

## Testing

Test coverage in `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_verifier.py`: valid/invalid program verification, property-based selection, exception vs. diagnostic modes, pass integration, diagnostic field access, report generation, structural/default property sets.

UseAfterDef-specific coverage in `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_verify_use_after_def.py`: valid programs (params, chained assigns, for loop body, return_var after loop), invalid programs (use-before-def, loop var out of scope, branch def not visible outside), error code/rule name verification, structural property membership.
