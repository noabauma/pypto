# Performance

Tuning a single-card kernel: making the execution visible first, then working through the
places time actually goes.

## The shape of the problem

A PyPTO kernel's wall-clock time is spent in three different machines, and they fail in
different ways:

```text
host          orchestration            AICore
 │                  │                     │
 ├─ copies          ├─ task dispatch      ├─ the kernel itself
 │  (06-host)       │  (01, 02, 03)       │  (04-incore)
 │                  │                     │
 └────────────── memory: on-chip buffers + runtime rings (05-memory) ──────┘
```

Most first-time tuning goes straight to the third column — the arithmetic inside the
kernel — and finds that the first two were the problem. The chapter is ordered so you meet
them in the order they usually bite.

## How to use it

Every technique below is written with the same four fields, because a speedup with an
unstated cost is not a result:

| Field | What it answers |
| ----- | --------------- |
| **When it applies** | The symptom that makes this the right move |
| **How** | The code change |
| **Cost** | What it spends — memory, generality, or a correctness obligation you now own |
| **How to confirm** | The artifact that shows it worked, and what should change in it |

**There are no speedup numbers in this chapter.** They depend on your shapes, platform, and
toolchain versions, and a stale number is worse than none because you cannot tell it has
gone stale. The confirmation step is the transferable part: run it on your kernel and you
have your own number.

## Before you tune anything

Two cheap checks come before any of this, and both are already done for you:

- **`report/perf_hints.log`** in the build output. The compiler writes what it noticed
  during compilation — undersized transfers, matmuls it could not tile, a pipeline depth
  that did not fit. One summary line goes to stderr on every compile.
- **The host/device split.** `run()` does not return a timing object — its
  `execution_time` is total wall clock, compile and golden included. Use
  `pypto.runtime.benchmark`, whose `BenchmarkStats` carries `device_wall_us` and
  `host_wall_us` separately. If the time is on the host, nothing in pages 00–05 will move
  it — go to [Host](06-host.md).
