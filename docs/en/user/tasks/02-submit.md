# Declaring an Edge

Naming a dispatch so a later one can wait on it.

> **Prerequisites:** [The dependency model](00-model.md) and [Runtime scopes](01-scopes.md).

## Concept

An ordinary kernel call becomes a task, but you never get a handle to it. To declare an edge
the inference cannot reach, you need a **TaskId** — a handle naming one dispatch — and a way
to pass it to a later task as a dependency.

There are three spellings, and which ones you can use is decided by how the function is
written, not by preference:

| Spelling | Available in | Names the task |
| -------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| `with pl.at(level=..., deps=[...]) as tid:` | `@pl.jit` and `@pl.function` | An inline region |
| `with pl.spmd(n, deps=[...]) as tid:` | `@pl.jit` and `@pl.function` | An inline multi-block region |
| `result, tid = pl.submit(self.kernel, ...)` | `@pl.program` classes only | A pre-declared kernel |

The two scope forms bind the TaskId with `as`; `pl.submit` returns it. `pl.submit` requires
its callee to be written as `self.<kernel>` — a method of the enclosing `@pl.program` class
— so it is not reachable from a `@pl.jit` function, where kernels are plain module-level
functions. All three feed the same `deps=` machinery.

**Explicit edges are not tied to manual scope.** `deps=` composes with automatic tracking —
the final wait set is the union of both — so an explicit edge is perfectly at home in an
ordinary auto scope. Use it there as a precision tool for the one edge the inference could
not reach; use [`pl.manual_scope`](01-scopes.md) only when you want the whole graph.

## Quickstart: an explicit edge in an auto scope

```python
import pypto.language as pl

@pl.jit
def two_stage(
    x: pl.Tensor[[256, 128], pl.FP32],
    scratch: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[256, 128], pl.FP32]],
    out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[256, 128], pl.FP32]],
):
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP) as first:
        scratch[:] = pl.add(x, x)
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, deps=[first]) as second:
        out[:] = pl.add(scratch, scratch)
    return scratch, out
```

| Element | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| `as first` | Binds the TaskId of the region — the handle a later task names |
| `deps=[first]` | This region waits on that producer, whatever the OverlapMap did or did not infer |

Note there is no `manual_scope` here. The `deps=` is added on top of normal tracking, not
instead of it.

## Mechanics

### `pl.at` as a task boundary

Every `pl.at` region is one dispatch, so binding it with `as tid` gives you its TaskId.
The dependency keywords are:

| Keyword | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `deps=[...]` | TaskId scalars / arrays this region must wait on |
| `no_dep_args=[...]` | Tensors to opt out of tracking — see [Refining the graph](03-tuning.md) |
| `dumps=[...]` | Tensors to mark for selective dump |
| `allow_early_resolve=True` | Scheduling hint — see [Refining the graph](03-tuning.md) |

`pl.at` has no `predicate=`. For a predicated region use `pl.spmd` or a submit form.

### `pl.spmd` as a task boundary

`pl.spmd(n)` — covered as a placement construct in
[Scopes and Placement](../language/04-scopes.md) — is also one dispatch, so it names a task
the same way:

```python
with pl.spmd(4, name_hint="stage1") as first:
    ...
with pl.spmd(4, name_hint="stage2", deps=[first]) as second:
    ...
```

It accepts `deps=`, `predicate=` and `allow_early_resolve=`, which makes it the one inline
form that carries a dispatch predicate.

All three forms take `deps=`. Binding with `as` is what gives you *this* dispatch's TaskId,
so you only need it when a later task must wait on this one — `with pl.spmd(4, deps=[...]):`
and `for i in pl.spmd(4, deps=[...]):` declare edges just as well without naming themselves.

### `pl.submit`

For programs written as a `@pl.program` class with pre-declared kernels:

```text
result, tid = pl.submit(self.kernel, *kernel_args, deps=[...], dumps=[...],
                        allow_early_resolve=False, timing_slot=N, predicate=(...))
```

The positional slots after the callee are the kernel's own arguments; everything else is an
optional keyword. The callee **must** be written `self.<kernel>` — any other expression is a
parse error.

The unpacking shapes that work:

```python
a, tid = pl.submit(self.k1, x)          # result and TaskId
res    = pl.submit(self.k1, x)          # whole flat tuple in one name
```

A TaskId reached by indexing that flat tuple cannot feed `deps=` — the dependency must be a
TaskId variable or a TASK_ID array element, so bind it by name.

### `pl.spmd_submit`

The SPMD sibling: one orchestration task the runtime fans out across `core_num` logical
blocks, each kernel reading its own index via `pl.tile.get_block_idx()`. It still returns a
single producer TaskId, so the whole fan-out is named as one dependency.

```python
a, tid = pl.spmd_submit(self.k1, x, core_num=8)
```

`core_num` is a **required keyword** — the positional slots belong to the kernel.
`sync_start` (default `False`) requires all blocks to launch atomically. `deps=`,
`allow_early_resolve=`, `timing_slot=` and `predicate=` behave exactly as on `pl.submit`.

### Device timing slots

`timing_slot=N` (`N` is an integer literal from `0` through `15`) tags one task
for device timing. The runtime emits one span for each slot: from the earliest
dispatch to the latest completion among all tasks tagged with that slot. Tag two
related tasks with the same slot to measure their combined device region, while
leaving warmup and an alignment barrier untagged:

```python
_, barrier_tid = pl.submit(self.warmup_barrier, signal)
mid, _ = pl.spmd_submit(self.stage_a, x, core_num=N, deps=[barrier_tid], timing_slot=0)
out, _ = pl.spmd_submit(self.stage_b, mid, w, core_num=N, deps=[barrier_tid], timing_slot=0)
```

The resulting trace span is named
`chip.run.runner_run.device_wall.task_slot_0`. A slot is local to one device;
for L3, aggregate its duration as the maximum across ranks, not by comparing
timestamps from different devices.

### `pl.submit` in a distributed HOST orchestrator

Inside a distributed program's HOST-level orchestrator (`@pl.function(level=pl.Level.HOST,
role=pl.Role.Orchestrator)`), `pl.submit` names a chip dispatch the same way — but the
TaskId is backed by the L3 runtime's opaque `TaskHandle`, and each `deps=[producer]` entry
lowers to `TaskArgs.add_dep_wait(producer)`: an ordering-only edge that does not extend the
producer's resource lifetime. Explicit edges add to the automatically maintained per-rank
communication ordering; declare one when a rank's dispatches interact through a comm window
in an order you want pinned explicitly — e.g. a WAIT living in a different dispatch from the
same rank's SEND:

```python
_sent, send_task = pl.submit(self.send_orch, x, echo, dst, signal, peer, device=rank)
_received, _ = pl.submit(self.recv_orch, out, dst, signal, device=rank,
                         deps=[send_task])
```

Two differences from the L2 form above:

- **Every callee argument is required, including `Out` / `InOut` tensors** — L3 does not
  allocate output tensors, so nothing can fill an omitted slot.
- **Only `deps=` is available.** `core_num`, `sync_start`, `allow_early_resolve` and
  `predicate=` have no L3 counterpart and are rejected; `pl.spmd_submit` is likewise not
  available at HOST level.

### Fan-in through a TaskId array

One TaskId names one task. To wait on a *set* of tasks — a loop's worth of producers —
collect them in a `pl.array` of `pl.TASK_ID` and pass the array itself as a dependency:

```python
tids = pl.array.create(branches, pl.TASK_ID)
for branch in pl.parallel(branches):
    out, tid = pl.submit(self.producer, data, branch, out)
    tids[branch] = tid
out, _ = pl.submit(self.consumer, data, out, deps=[tids])
```

`deps=` accepts arrays as well as scalars, so the consumer waits on every producer the loop
created. Remember that an array update rebinds — inside a loop the array is a carried value
like any other. See [Control Flow](../language/02-control-flow.md).

## Edge Cases

> **Fatal pitfall:** `deps=` is the *only* thing an explicit edge gives you. It does not
> imply a manual scope, and a manual scope does not imply edges. Mixing the two ideas up —
> assuming `manual_scope` orders the statements inside it — produces a region where nothing
> is ordered at all.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | --- |
| **`pl.submit(...) first argument must be a self.<kernel> method reference`** | `pl.submit` used in a `@pl.jit` function | Use `with pl.at(..., deps=[...]) as tid:` — or `with pl.spmd(n, deps=[...]) as tid:` for a multi-block dispatch |
| **`pl.submit is a DSL parser construct and cannot be called directly`** | Used outside a decorated function body | Move it inside the decorated body |
| **`unpacks 1 result value(s) but kernel returns 0`** | The kernel writes an `Out` parameter and declares no return type | Unpack only what the kernel returns, or give it a return type |
| **`deps= entries must be a TaskId variable`** | A TaskId reached by indexing a flat submit result | Bind the TaskId to its own name and pass that |
| **`pl.spmd(..., deps=[...]) cannot be nested inside pl.cluster()`** | A cluster-nested `pl.spmd` is unwrapped into the Group and never produces a task to hang edges on | Drop the `pl.cluster()` wrapper — a standalone `pl.spmd` is its own implicit cluster and does take `deps=` |
| **`core_num` missing** | It is a required keyword on `pl.spmd_submit` | Pass `core_num=N`; positional slots are the kernel's arguments |
| **`requires every callee argument, including Out/InOut tensors`** | A distributed HOST submit omitted an `Out`/`InOut` argument | Pass every callee argument — L3 does not allocate outputs |
| **A consumer only waits on the last producer of a loop** | One TaskId was reused instead of collected | Collect into a `pl.array` of `pl.TASK_ID` and pass the array |
| **Explicit edge seems ignored in auto scope** | It is not — the wait set is the union | Look for a *missing* edge elsewhere, not a discarded one |

## Worked examples

| Example | Shows |
| ------- | ----- |
| `examples/intermediate/07_task_graph.py` | One inferred edge and one declared edge, side by side |
| `examples/models/02_vector_dag.py` | Three InCore kernels wired into a DAG from one entry |
| `examples/utils/phase_fence_dep_compression.py` | Four fan-out stages, each gating on the previous stage's whole TaskId array |
