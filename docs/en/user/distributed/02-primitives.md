# Primitives

Most users call `pld.tensor.*` collectives directly — reach for these
lower-level primitives only when building a custom protocol.

> **Note:** the notify/wait, put/get, and remote-load/store code blocks
> below are illustrative sketches — they omit `nranks`/`my_rank`
> derivation and buffer setup and are not meant to run as-is. For
> runnable versions, see [Runnable Examples](#runnable-examples) below.

## Types and Enums

| Name | Values | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| `NotifyOp` | `AtomicAdd`, `Set` | Signal deposit mode. `AtomicAdd`: atomically increment the peer's signal slot (use for multi-rank barriers). `Set`: overwrite the peer's signal slot (use for 1:1 handshakes). |
| `WaitCmp` | `Eq`, `Ge` | Wait predicate. `Eq`: block until signal slot equals expected value. `Ge`: block until signal slot >= expected value. |
| `ReduceOp` | `Sum`, `Max`, `Min`, `Prod` | Reduction operator for collective operations. Support is per-operation: `allreduce` accepts all four; `reduce_scatter` accepts only `Sum` and rejects the rest at the deducer. |
| `AtomicType` | `None_`, `Add` | Remote-store combine mode. `None_`: plain store. `Add`: atomically accumulate into peer's destination — requires an `fp32`/`bf16`/`fp16`/`int32`/`int16`/`int8` destination, and a `bf16` destination requires the Ascend910B (A2/A3) profile. |
| `DistributedTensor` | — | A tensor view bound to a comm-domain window buffer. Every collective and RMA op requires this type on the window side. |
| `CommCtx` | — | Communication context handle. Produced by `get_comm_ctx()`; consumed by `rank()` and `nranks()`. |

## System Substrate (`pld.system.*`)

These are the lowest-level distributed primitives. Scope varies per op —
`world_size` is host-only; `get_comm_ctx` works in both host orchestrator and
InCore kernel code; `rank`, `nranks`, `notify`, `wait`, and `defer_wait` have codegen
support only in InCore kernel code (there is no host-orchestrator lowering
for them).

| Name | Signature | Description |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `world_size` | `() -> Scalar` | **Host-only.** Number of ranks in the distributed execution. Returns `INT64`. |
| `get_comm_ctx` | `(dist_tensor: DT) -> Ctx` | Lift a `DistributedTensor` to its `CommCtx` handle. Works in host orchestrator and InCore code. The verifier rejects plain `pl.Tensor`. |
| `rank` | `(ctx: Ctx) -> Scalar` | **InCore-only.** Local rank index (`INT32`). Lowers to a load of `CommContext::rankId`. |
| `nranks` | `(ctx: Ctx) -> Scalar` | **InCore-only.** Number of ranks in this comm group (`INT32`). Lowers to a load of `CommContext::rankNum`. |
| `notify` | `(target: DT, peer: IntLike, offsets: Sequence[IntLike], value: IntLike, *, op: NotifyOp) -> Call` | **InCore-only.** Cross-rank signal deposit. **Side-effect-only** — no return value. Lowers to `TNOTIFY`. |
| `wait` | `(signal: DT, offsets: Sequence[IntLike], expected: IntLike, *, cmp: WaitCmp) -> Call` | **InCore-only.** Cross-rank wait. **Side-effect-only** — blocks until the local signal slot satisfies `cmp(expected)`. Lowers to `TWAIT`. |
| `defer_wait` | `(signal: DT, offsets: Sequence[IntLike], expected: IntLike, *, cmp: WaitCmp) -> Call` | **Dedicated top-level `pl.at(CORE_GROUP)` waiter only.** Registers `signal[offsets] >= expected` as a completion condition and returns without spinning the AIV. The enclosing task's TaskId remains incomplete until the condition is ready. |

## Window Buffer Management (`pld.tensor.*`)

`window` and `alloc_window_buffer` live in `pld.tensor.*`, not `pld.system.*`,
even though they are as foundational as the substrate above.

| Name | Signature | Description |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `window` | `(buf: Ptr, shape: Sequence[IntLike], *, dtype: DataType) -> DT` | Materialise a window-buffer `Ptr` as a `DistributedTensor` view. `buf` comes from `alloc_window_buffer`. |
| `alloc_window_buffer` | `(size: IntLike, *, name: str = "") -> Ptr` | Allocate a per-rank HCCL window buffer. **Size is in bytes.** The `name` kwarg is injected by the parser from the LHS assignment — never pass it explicitly. |
| `alloc_window_buffer` | `(shape: Sequence[IntLike], *, dtype: DataType, name: str = "") -> Ptr` | Convenience overload. `size = prod(shape) x dtype.get_byte()` computed automatically. |

## Notify & Wait: The Signal Handshake

The lowest-level synchronisation primitive. Each rank writes to a peer's
signal cell, then blocks until its own cell has been written.

```python
@pl.jit.incore
def handshake_step(
    out: pl.Out[pl.Tensor[[1, 1], pl.INT32]],
    signal: pl.InOut[pld.DistributedTensor[[1, 1], pl.INT32]],
    peer: pl.Scalar[pl.INT32],
    tag: pl.Scalar[pl.INT32],
) -> pl.Tensor[[1, 1], pl.INT32]:
    # 1. Write our tag into the peer's signal cell.
    pld.system.notify(
        signal, peer=peer, offsets=[0, 0],
        value=tag, op=pld.NotifyOp.Set,
    )

    # 2. Wait until our own cell has been written.
    pld.system.wait(
        signal=signal, offsets=[0, 0],
        expected=1, cmp=pld.WaitCmp.Ge,
    )

    # 3. Read the received tag back out.
    received = pl.read(signal, [0, 0])
    pl.write(out, [0, 0], received)
    return out
```

> The `wait` uses `Ge` with `expected=1`, which means the peer's `tag`
> **must be >= 1**. Passing `tag=0` will cause a permanent hang.

### `notify` in a mixed cube+vector kernel

Everything above assumes one notify runs once. In a kernel that mixes
`pl.matmul` with comm ops, that is not automatic, and **nothing diagnoses it**:

- **Outside a `pl.split_aiv` region**, the notify has no declared core, so the
  compiler emits it on the cube lane *and* the vector lane. Put comm phases
  inside a region and the compiler keeps them off the cube lane.
- **Inside a `mode=NONE` region**, the body runs on **both AIV sub-lanes**, so a
  notify still fires twice unless you shard it by `aiv_id` or guard it to one
  lane.

Both rules, the failure they prevent, and the ordering obligation the guarded
form carries are in
[Scopes → pl.split_aiv](../language/04-scopes.md). Read that before writing a
notify next to cube work.

### Choosing NotifyOp and WaitCmp

| Scenario | NotifyOp | WaitCmp | Why |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | --- |
| 1:1 exchange (one writer per slot) | `Set` | `Eq` or `Ge` | Atomic increment not needed — overwrite is clear and fast. |
| N-to-1 barrier (many writers, one slot) | `AtomicAdd` | `Ge` | Every writer atomically adds its contribution. The sum increments monotonically; wait for the expected total. |
| Multi-round protocol | `AtomicAdd` | `Ge` | The counter advances across rounds without reset — each round uses a fresh row or the caller re-allocates the buffer. |

**Expected output** for 2 ranks: rank 0 writes tag=2, waits for tag 1 from rank 1:
`outputs[0] == 1`. Rank 1 writes tag=1, waits for tag 2 from rank 0:
`outputs[1] == 2`. Result: `outputs == [[1], [2]]`.

> **Buffer re-use safety:** Signal cells are zero-initialised by
> `alloc_window_buffer`. After `notify`, the signal cell holds the written
> value; after `wait` returns, the caller has observed the barrier. These
> tile-level `notify`/`wait` primitives use monotonic counters that do not
> self-reset — allocate a fresh buffer per call. The `pld.tensor.*`
> collectives are the exception: their signal buffers are self-clearing and
> reusable across back-to-back calls.

## Deferred Completion: Release the Core, Keep the Task Pending

`pld.system.wait` is a blocking `TWAIT`: the AIV stays in the kernel and the
statements after the wait resume on that same AIV. `pld.system.defer_wait` has
a different contract. It registers a counter condition with the runtime and
returns; when the dedicated waiter kernel ends, its **physical AIV is free**, but
the waiter's **logical TaskId is still incomplete**. The scheduler resolves that
TaskId only after every registered condition is satisfied. The kernel is never
resumed, so continuation work must be a separate task.

```python
# Each rank's publisher is independent: publish payload first, then the signal.
with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, name_hint="publish"):
    pld.tensor.remote_store(payload_value, peer_payload, peer, [0, 0])
    pld.system.notify(
        signal, peer=peer, offsets=[my_rank, 0],
        value=epoch, op=pld.NotifyOp.Set,
    )

# Receiver: observe the peer publisher. There is deliberately no local
# publisher -> waiter dependency; add deps only for real local ordering.
with pl.at(
    level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP,
    name_hint="payload_wait",
    allow_early_resolve=False,
) as wait_tid:
    pld.system.defer_wait(
        signal, offsets=[peer, 0], expected=epoch,
        cmp=pld.WaitCmp.Ge,
    )

# The consumer is not dispatched until wait_tid is logically complete.
with pl.at(
    level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP,
    name_hint="consume_payload",
    deps=[wait_tid],
) as consume_tid:
    payload_tile = pl.load(peer_payload, [0, 0], [1, WIDTH])
    # ... consume payload_tile ...
```

An inline SPMD consumer uses the captured form as well:

```python
with pl.spmd(
    NUM_BLOCKS,
    name_hint="consume_payload_spmd",
    deps=[wait_tid],
) as consume_tid:
    block = pl.get_block_idx()
    # ... each AIV block reads its payload partition ...
```

There is no second dependency namespace for deferred completion. `deps` keeps
its normal strict TaskId meaning: Simpler dynamically delays completion of the
ordinary waiter TaskId after its AIV retires, so the existing dependency edge
does not release the consumer until the registered counter is ready. The
standard Simpler AICore executor already invalidates the entire data cache
immediately after it picks up every task (before the optional speculative gate
and before that task's kernel reads its inputs). The waiter is not eligible for
early resolve, so its direct consumer is never pre-staged at that gate: it is
picked up through the normal path only after the counter-backed TaskId
completes. Its task-start invalidation therefore happens after readiness. On
the producer side, all payload writes must still
become visible **before** the notify is published; task-start invalidation
cannot repair a notify-before-data bug.

### Deferred-wait contract

- Put `defer_wait` in a dedicated, top-level task
  `with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP) as wait_tid:` scope. This task-level
  launch lets PyPTO validate single-block execution and provide the runtime
  `AsyncCtx`. An unmarked direct `@pl.jit.incore` / AIV use is rejected because
  it bypasses those contracts; programmatically constructed internal IR is accepted
  only after PyPTO revalidates the complete waiter body and orchestration call site.
- The waiter must be pure AIV, cannot have a dispatch predicate, and cannot use
  `allow_early_resolve=True`. Pure scalar bookkeeping and control flow may run
  between registrations, but `tensor.read`, payload/cache operations, and other
  communication cannot continue after registration begins. This follows Simpler's own
  early-dispatch contract: leaving the waiter at `False` disqualifies its direct
  consumers from being pre-staged before the counter-backed TaskId completes.
  A normal consumer may choose its own `allow_early_resolve` value; that value
  governs pre-staging of the consumer's downstream tasks, not whether it may
  bypass the waiter.
- `signal` must be a direct, window-bound INT32 `DistributedTensor` parameter;
  slices, views, and other aliases are not supported. V1 accepts only
  `cmp=pld.WaitCmp.Ge`.
- Conditions use monotonic uint32 polling (`counter >= expected`) over INT32
  signal storage. Both `expected` and every published counter value must stay
  nonnegative in `[0, INT32_MAX]`; for example, storing `-1` is observed as
  `UINT32_MAX` and would satisfy every valid threshold. Dynamic expected values
  are checked at runtime. Do not reset or move a counter backwards while an
  older generation can still be pending, and do not rely on uint32 wraparound.
- One waiter task may register at most 64 conditions. Separately, one runtime
  scheduler may track at most 64 concurrently deferred tasks. These are two
  different limits and neither is a physical-core count.
- Connect continuation work with the same ordinary `deps=[..., wait_tid]`
  accepted for any TaskId dependency. Deferred completion does not impose a
  separate consumer kernel kind or dependency representation. A terminal
  waiter with no continuation may submit that task scope fire-and-forget and
  need not capture a TaskId.
- If a producer never advances the counter to `expected`, the AIV is not
  spinning, but the TaskId and every dependent consumer remain pending. The
  protocol must still guarantee eventual notification.

This mechanism is not asynchronous prefetch: `pl.prefetch.*` manages an SDMA
data-movement session/event, whereas deferred completion gates a scheduler
TaskId on a remote counter. It is also not host asynchronous execution—there
is no Python future, host callback, or host thread waiting for the signal.
Legacy `pld.system.wait` remains unchanged for code that must resume in the same
kernel and still supports both `Eq` and `Ge`.

## Tile-Level RMA (`pld.tile.*`)

Low-level cross-rank remote memory access. These are tile-level primitives used to build
collectives; most users call `pld.tensor.*` collectives instead.

| Name | Signature | Description |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `remote_load` | `(target: DT, peer: IntLike, offsets: Sequence[IntLike], shape: Sequence[IntLike], valid_shape=None) -> Tile` | Load a region of peer rank's `DT` into a local tile. `shape` defines the tile dimensions. `valid_shape` keeps the physical tile fixed-size while a ragged tail reads only real data. Offsets must match what the peer stored — a 1-element misalignment causes silent corruption. |
| `remote_store` | `(src_tile: Tile, target: DT, peer: IntLike, offsets: Sequence[IntLike], *, atomic=AtomicType.None_) -> Call` | Write a local tile into peer rank's `DT`. Side-effect-only. `atomic=Add` accumulates into the peer's region instead of overwriting. The pushed region must fit inside `target` at `offsets`. |

`remote_store` also exists one IR level up as **`pld.tensor.remote_store`**
`(src: Tensor, target: DT, peer: IntLike, offsets, *, atomic=...)`, for pushing a
*computed* value out of a tensor-level `@pl.jit` kernel (where there are no tiles
to name). It lowers 1:1 to the tile form, so the value reaches the peer as a single
remote write with no global-memory round-trip. The short form `pld.remote_store`
dispatches between the two on the operand you pass.

## Put and Get (`pld.tensor.*`)

One-sided bulk transfer — rank A writes to or reads from rank B's window
without rank B participating in the transfer (beyond the signal barrier).

### Put (Write to Peer)

| Name | Signature | Mutation | Description |
| ---- | --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `put` | `(dst: DT, peer: IntLike, src: DT \| Tensor, dst_offsets=None, src_offsets=None, shape=None, *, atomic=AtomicType.None_, chunk_rows=0, chunk_cols=0, pipeline=False) -> Call` | `dst: InOut`, `src: In` | Write local `src` into peer rank's `dst`. `dst` **must** be window-bound; `src` may be plain `Tensor`. With no offsets/shape, writes the full local slice. `atomic=Add` accumulates instead of overwriting (hardware atomic-add dtypes only: `fp32`/`bf16`/`fp16`/`int32`/`int16`/`int8`; `bf16` is Ascend910B-only). |

### Get (Read from Peer)

| Name | Signature | Mutation | Description |
| ---- | --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `get` | `(dst: DT \| Tensor, peer: IntLike, src: DT, dst_offsets=None, src_offsets=None, shape=None, *, chunk_rows=0, chunk_cols=0, pipeline=False) -> Call` | `dst: Out`, `src: In` | Read peer rank's `src` into local `dst`. `src` **must** be window-bound; `dst` may be plain `Tensor`. |

### Chunking and Pipelining Constraints

`chunk_rows`/`chunk_cols` (`0` = full extent) shrink the staging tile so a
transfer larger than the on-chip staging budget still moves in one call,
sliding through the smaller stage automatically.

> **Fatal pitfall:** `pipeline=True` **requires both `chunk_rows > 0` and
> `chunk_cols > 0`** — the double-buffering benefit only exists when the
> transfer is actually chunked. Passing `pipeline=True` with either chunk
> dimension left at `0` raises a `ValueError` before dispatch.

A **dynamic** transfer extent (a runtime-sized `shape`, or a full-slice
transfer where `dst`/`src`'s own dims are dynamic) must be bounded by a
matching static chunk: a dynamic innermost dimension requires `chunk_cols`
to be set, and a dynamic leading dimension requires `chunk_rows` to be set —
the staging tile is allocated statically and can't size itself from a
runtime value.

## Writing Your Own Collective

Every built-in collective is a composition of lower-level primitives. The
mesh allreduce is: stage-in -> barrier -> remote-accumulate -> stage-out.

### The Barrier in Isolation

```python
# signal: pld.DistributedTensor[[NR, 1], pl.INT32]
for peer in pl.range(nranks):
    if peer != my_rank:
        pld.system.notify(
            signal, peer=peer, offsets=[my_rank, 0],
            value=1, op=pld.NotifyOp.AtomicAdd,
        )
for src in pl.range(nranks):
    if src != my_rank:
        pld.system.wait(
            signal, offsets=[src, 0],
            expected=1, cmp=pld.WaitCmp.Ge,
        )
```

With `offsets=[my_rank, 0]`, each rank owns a dedicated row — cell `[r, 0]`
in every peer's window has exactly one writer, rank `r` itself, so `Set`
would work identically here. `AtomicAdd` is shown because this is the same
notify call every barrier in this doc uses; the "many writers, one slot"
case that actually requires `AtomicAdd` is a *shared*-cell barrier (see the
table above) — give every rank a distinct offset like this one only when you
need to distinguish *which* peers have arrived, not just *whether* everyone
has.

### Remote Accumulate

```python
acc = pl.load(data, [0, 0], [1, SIZE])
for peer in pl.range(nranks):
    if peer != my_rank:
        peer_tile = pld.tile.remote_load(
            data, peer=peer, offsets=[0, 0], shape=[1, SIZE]
        )
        acc = pl.add(acc, peer_tile)
```

`remote_load` reads the peer's window slice into a local tile. The offset
and shape must match what the peer stored — a mismatch reads garbage.

## 2-Segment vs 3-Segment Namespace

| Short form (`pld.*`) | Full path |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| `pld.world_size()` | `pld.system.world_size()` |
| `pld.rank(ctx)` | `pld.system.rank(ctx)` |
| `pld.nranks(ctx)` | `pld.system.nranks(ctx)` |
| `pld.get_comm_ctx(dt)` | `pld.system.get_comm_ctx(dt)` |
| `pld.alloc_window_buffer(...)` | `pld.tensor.alloc_window_buffer(...)` |
| `pld.window(...)` | `pld.tensor.window(...)` |
| `pld.remote_load(...)` | `pld.tile.remote_load(...)` |
| `pld.remote_store(...)` | `pld.tile.remote_store(...)` / `pld.tensor.remote_store(...)` (dispatches on `src`) |

**No short form:** `pld.notify(...)`, `pld.wait(...)`, `pld.defer_wait(...)`, `pld.put(...)`,
`pld.get(...)`, `pld.allreduce(...)`, and all other collective ops — these
require the full 3-segment namespace.
