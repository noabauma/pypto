"""MkDocs build hooks for the PyPTO documentation site.

The docs deliberately link to source files outside ``docs/`` — ``python/pypto/**``,
``include/pypto/**``, ``examples/**``, ``.claude/rules/**`` — using repo-relative
paths, so a reader browsing the repository on GitHub can click straight through to
the code. MkDocs cannot resolve those targets (they are not documentation pages),
and ``mkdocs build --strict`` turns each one into a build failure.

This hook rewrites exactly those links to absolute GitHub blob URLs while the site
is being built. The markdown on disk is untouched, so it stays the single source of
truth and stays clickable on GitHub.

See https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#hooks for the hook protocol.
