"""DSL wrappers for the opaque async-prefetch handles.

Three handle classes back the ``pl.prefetch.*`` surface, each serving the two
roles :class:`pld.CommCtx` does:

* **Type annotation** — ``ctx: pl.PrefetchAsyncContext = pl.prefetch.make_context()``
  declares an :class:`ir.PrefetchAsyncContextType`-valued ``Var`` in printed IR.
* **Value wrapper** — the ``pl.prefetch.*`` wrappers return these classes so
  handles flow through the DSL as typed values instead of raw ``ir.Call``
  objects. The parser's ``invoke_dsl`` unwraps via :meth:`unwrap` at the
  parser boundary.
