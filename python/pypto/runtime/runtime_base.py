"""Shared :class:`Worker` ABC for all PyPTO runtime handles.

PyPTO's L2 handle :class:`~pypto.runtime.ChipWorker` and L3 handle
:class:`~pypto.runtime.distributed_runner.DistributedWorker` both inherit from
:class:`Worker`. The ABC factors out three orthogonal surfaces shared by every
level:

- **Device-memory primitives** — ``malloc`` / ``free`` / ``copy_to`` /
  ``copy_from`` are abstract; each subclass routes them to its own backend
  (``ChipWorker`` to ``self._impl.*``; ``DistributedWorker`` via the
  orchestrator facade).
- **DeviceTensor lifecycle** — :meth:`alloc_tensor` and :meth:`free_tensor` are
  concrete here. Tensors allocated through :meth:`alloc_tensor` are tracked in
  ``self._owned_tensors`` and released by :meth:`_close_owned_tensors`, which
  subclasses call from their own ``close()`` so a missed ``free_tensor`` never
  leaks past the Worker.
- **Dispatch surface** — :meth:`run` and :meth:`register` are abstract; library
  code that doesn't care about the level should type-hint against
  :class:`Worker` and call these.

Two hooks cover the genuine differences between the levels:

- :meth:`Worker._require_ready` — the per-op readiness guard.
- :meth:`Worker._prepare_init` — the host-init upload policy. L2 makes a
  defensive CPU copy; L3 forbids the copy and requires shared memory, because
  its upload runs inside a forked child that only sees host memory it inherited
  at fork.

      :meth:`copy_from` with backend-appropriate routing and a readiness guard.
    - Implement :meth:`run` and :meth:`register` for the level's dispatch
      semantics. ``register`` should return a :class:`RegistrationHandle`.
    - Override :meth:`_require_ready` to match the level's lifecycle (e.g.,
      ``ChipWorker`` requires :meth:`init`; ``DistributedWorker`` requires
      not-yet-closed).
    - Override :meth:`_prepare_init` if the host-init upload policy differs
      from L2's defensive CPU copy.

      tearing down its backend so any tensor the caller forgot to release is
