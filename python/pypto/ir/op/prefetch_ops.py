"""Asynchronous GM->L2 prefetch operations for PyPTO IR.

These ops express a latency-hiding cache hint: they warm L2 with a global-memory
region while unrelated compute proceeds, and change no tensor values.

- make_context: build a prefetch context backed by a runtime-injected workspace
- async_prefetch: start one async GM -> L2 prefetch, returning a completion event
- session: project the async session bound to a context
- wait: wait for a prefetch event to complete within its session

Unlike most PTO intrinsics the underlying ``TPREFETCH_ASYNC`` carries no implicit
wait-event synchronization, so completion is explicit via the event/session pair.
The runtime owns the SDMA workspace and injects it through a hidden codegen
parameter; it is never an IR operand. A runtime without an SDMA provider fails
during worker initialization rather than supplying a fallback workspace.
