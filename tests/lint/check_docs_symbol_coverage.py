"""Fail when a public ``pl.*`` symbol is documented nowhere in the user manual.

The user manual promises that every user-visible capability is findable. This
check enforces the mechanical half of that promise: each name in
``pypto.language.__all__`` must appear in some code span under ``docs/en/user/``.

``__all__`` is read **statically** with ``ast`` rather than by importing
``pypto.language`` — the import would need the compiled extension, which
pre-commit environments do not have.

Symbols whose chapter is not written yet live in ``DEFERRED`` with the batch
that will cover them. That list is expected to shrink to empty; it is not a
place to park a symbol nobody wants to document.

Usage:
    python tests/lint/check_docs_symbol_coverage.py           # gate
    python tests/lint/check_docs_symbol_coverage.py --report  # list, always exit 0
