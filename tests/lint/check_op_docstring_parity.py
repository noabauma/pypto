"""
Script to check that a DSL op wrapper does not drop the explanation its IR twin carries.

Every operator is written twice in Python: ``pypto/ir/op/<ns>_ops.py`` takes raw ``ir.Expr`` with an
explicit ``span`` and returns an ``ir.Call``; ``pypto/language/op/<ns>_ops.py`` takes ``Tile`` /
``Tensor``, auto-captures the span, and returns a wrapped object. Only the second one is published:
``docs/en/user/api/{tile,tensor}.md`` render ``pypto.language.tile`` and ``pypto.language.tensor``
through mkdocstrings, so the DSL docstring *is* the user manual and the IR docstring is read by
compiler developers.

The failure mode this catches is that the two drift in the wrong direction. The add-op workflow asks
for a docstring on the IR wrapper but describes the DSL wrapper as ``unwrap -> call -> wrap``, so a
new op tends to get its shape rules, broadcasting semantics and dtype restrictions written on the
*internal* copy and only a one-line summary on the *published* one. Users then read the lossy
paraphrase while the real explanation sits in a module they never import.

The rule enforced here is structural, so it has no fuzzy similarity threshold and no false positives
from legitimate rewording:

    If the IR wrapper's docstring has a body -- a prose paragraph after the summary, or a section
    other than Args/Arguments/Returns/Yields (Note, Example, Warning, ...) -- then the DSL wrapper's
    docstring must have a body too.

One relocation is recognized rather than reported: when every IR body paragraph opens with a
parameter name (``core_type`` targets the operation to one lane ...), it is a note *about that
parameter*, and the published layer's convention is to carry it in the parameter's own ``Args``
entry. The check accepts that placement instead of demanding a redundant paragraph above ``Args``.

It deliberately does *not* compare the two bodies. The DSL copy is expected to differ: it drops the
``span`` argument and codegen internals, names ``pl.tile.foo`` where the IR copy names
``tile.foo``, and is frequently longer and better than its twin. What it must not do is say nothing
at all where the internal copy explains something.

Note that the fix is always a **source literal**. Assigning ``__doc__`` at import time from the
wrapped function does not work: ``docs/requirements.txt`` records that mkdocstrings reads
``python/pypto`` through griffe, which "parses the source statically -- nothing is imported", so a
runtime-assigned ``__doc__`` renders as an empty description on exactly the page being fixed.

Scope and deliberate limits:

* Only module-level functions defined in *both* layers of the same namespace are paired. A helper
  that exists on one side only, or a name re-exported from elsewhere, is not this check's business.
* A DSL wrapper with *no* docstring at all is reported, not skipped: it is the extreme of the same
  defect, since the published page then renders an empty description. Nothing else catches it --
  ``[tool.ruff.lint] select`` is ``PL, I, E, W, F, UP``, so pydocstyle (``D``) is not enabled. No op
  is in that state today; the check is here so the first one cannot land quietly.
* A pair whose *IR* docstring is missing is skipped -- there is then nothing to carry across, and
  "every internal wrapper is documented" is a different check.
* Overloads (``@typing.overload`` stubs) are ignored; only the implementation carries the docstring.
