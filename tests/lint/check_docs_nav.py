"""Fail if mkdocs.yml's nav and the docs/en tree disagree.

Two invariants, each of which breaks the documentation site when violated:

1. Every nav entry exists. A stale path makes `mkdocs build --strict` fail.
2. Every English page is in the nav. A page missing from the nav is reachable only
   by guessing its URL — the site never links to it.

The nav is declared with default-locale (`en/...`) paths; mkdocs-static-i18n swaps
in the docs/zh counterpart for the Chinese build, so only docs/en is checked
here. That the two trees mirror each other is check_docs_en_zh_parity.py's job.

Runs without MkDocs installed (PyYAML only).
