Script to check that reserved ``Function.attrs`` keys are declared once per layer and agree.

Each key is a contract between a writer pass and a reader that may sit on the other side of the
C++/Python boundary -- ``split_aiv`` is stamped by ``ScopeOutliner`` and read by ``MemoryReuse`` to
gate an Ascend910B in-place hazard guard; ``dual_aiv_dispatch`` is stamped in ``src/ir/transforms``
and read by both codegens and by the torch debug emitter. A key spelled as a bare literal at each of
those sites has no single point of rename: a writer renamed without its readers leaves every reader
silently reading an absent attr, which reads as "feature off" rather than as an error.

The keys are therefore declared once in C++ (``include/pypto/ir/function.h``, which also carries the
authoritative per-key lifecycle documentation) and once in Python (``python/pypto/_function_attrs``).
This check enforces three things:

1. *Parity* -- every key the Python module declares pairs with a C++ declaration holding the same
   string, so a key renamed on one side cannot drift from the other. The C++ header is the
   authoritative list and may declare keys Python has no use for (``spmd_unwrapped`` today); the
   reverse is an error, since a Python-only key names an attr no pass writes.
2. *Name agreement* -- ``kAttrDualAivDispatch`` in C++ pairs with ``DUAL_AIV_DISPATCH_ATTR`` in
   Python. The identifiers are mechanically derived from one another, so a mismatched pair is
   reported even when both sides happen to hold the same string.
3. *No redeclaration* -- no other source may spell one of these key strings as a bare literal at a
   site that provably reads or writes ``attrs``. That is the shape the declarations exist to replace.

Scope and deliberate limits:

* Only the keys declared in ``function.h`` are policed. ``Call`` / ``Submit`` attrs live in
  ``expr.h`` and ForStmt / pass-internal attrs in ``transforms/utils/attrs.h``; those are separate
  key spaces with their own owners, and folding them in here would make one failure message span
  three unrelated headers.
* Comments and docstrings are exempt -- prose naming a key is documentation, not a use. C++ comments
  are stripped before scanning; Python is parsed with ``ast`` so only real string literals are seen.
* Tests are exempt. A test that hand-builds ``attrs={"dual_aiv_dispatch": True}`` is asserting on the
  wire format itself, and pinning it to the constant would make the test pass vacuously after a
  rename -- exactly the failure it exists to catch.
* The C++ scan flags any bare occurrence; the Python scan flags only *attrs-anchored* shapes. Two
  keys are overloaded in Python and a blanket scan would be wrong about both: ``split_aiv`` also
  names the ``pl.split_aiv`` DSL construct (an ``__all__`` entry, a ``_VALID_ITERATORS`` member, a
  ``_loop_kind_stack`` sentinel), and ``auto_scope`` / ``external_source`` are also user-facing
  ``@pl.function(...)`` keyword parameters. Those are separate contracts that happen to share a
  spelling. The anchors below are the shapes that only an attr key takes:

  1. ``<expr naming attrs>.get("key", ...)`` -- ``dict(func.attrs).get(...)``,
     ``(func_attrs or {}).get(...)``, ``getattr(f, "attrs", {}).get(...)``.
  2. ``<expr naming attrs>["key"]`` -- subscript load or store.
  3. A dict-literal key in an assignment whose target names attrs --
     ``func_attrs = {**(func_attrs or {}), "auto_scope": False}``.
  4. A module-level collection whose name ends in ``_ATTRS`` -- ``_DECORATOR_ONLY_FUNC_ATTRS``.

  A literal reaching an attrs dict through a helper is not detected; that would need interprocedural
  analysis. Such sites are still worth converting by hand.
