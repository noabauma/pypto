"""Where a test case's IR comes from.

The compile pipeline needs exactly one thing from a test case: an
``ir.Program`` that **no pass has run on yet**, because ``ir.compile()`` runs
the pass pipeline *and* code generation itself.  Everything else about how the
kernel was authored is irrelevant to it.

``KernelSource`` is that one thing, so the three authoring surfaces stop being
three execution paths:

======================  =========================================
Authoring surface       KernelSource
======================  =========================================
``@pl.jit`` entry       :class:`JitKernel`
``@pl.program`` class   :class:`ProgramKernel`
an ``ir.Program``       :class:`IRKernel`
======================  =========================================

A source may also derive its own :class:`~harness.core.harness.TensorSpec`
list.  ``JitKernel`` can — parameter directions come from the kernel's
``pl.Out`` / ``pl.InOut`` annotations and shapes come from the sample tensors —
so a JIT-authored case never writes its shapes a second time.  The other two
return ``None`` and let the case declare them.

# Serialises every program build across the compile pool.
#
# Neither authoring surface is thread-safe: the ``@pl.program`` decorator
# mutates module-level builder state, and ``JITFunction``'s specializer walks
# and memoises a shared dep graph.  The compile pool runs ``build_program()``
# under this lock and everything after it — ``ir.compile()``, golden
# materialisation, the .so build — concurrently, which is where the parallelism
# actually is.
#
# One lock for all sources, on purpose: a per-source lock would let a
# ``@pl.program`` build race a JIT specialization, and the JIT specializer
# emits ``@pl.program`` source.
#
# Reentrant, because the acquisition nests: ``_compile_for_cache`` takes the
# lock around ``get_program()``, and for a ``Case`` that call lands right back
# here in ``build_program()``. Re-entering from the owning thread is safe by
# construction — the thread already has exclusive access and the nested build
# finishes before it releases — whereas a plain Lock self-deadlocks.
