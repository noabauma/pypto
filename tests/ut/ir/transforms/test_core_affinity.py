"""Unit tests for ``ClassifyCallAffinity`` (``src/ir/transforms/utils/core_affinity.cpp``).

``ClassifyCallAffinity`` decides which core executes a statement. It tries, in
order: the affinity declared at op registration, the dynamically-classified
special cases (``tile.move``, ``system.syncall``, the sync events, the
split-reshape ops), the op's output memory spec, and the first tile
*argument*'s memory space — falling back to SHARED, which ``ExpandMixedKernel``
duplicates onto both lanes.

This file characterises ``pld.tile.remote_load``, which falls off the end of
that list: it consumes a DistributedTensor plus scalar tuples and produces a
tile, so it declares no memory spec and offers no tile argument, and every rule
misses it. It therefore classifies SHARED — a **known gap**, benign today only
because the duplicated cube copy is dead and gets eliminated.

The tests below pin that behaviour deliberately, so that a future change to it
is a conscious one. See ``src/ir/op/distributed/remote_load.cpp`` for why the
two obvious fixes are both unsafe: declaring VECTOR is a false ISA claim (the
destination could be a cube-side buffer), and classifying from the *result*
tile makes ``LowerAutoVectorSplit`` treat the op as halvable when its
``offsets`` / ``shape`` tuples have no rewrite in the halving path.
