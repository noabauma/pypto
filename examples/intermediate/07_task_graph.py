"""
Ordering between tasks: the edge the runtime infers, and the one you declare.

The runtime does not run an orchestration function statement by statement. It
builds a dependency graph and runs whatever is ready, deriving edges from the
buffers each task touches and the direction each parameter declares. Writing one
dispatch after another therefore orders nothing by itself.

Kernels:
  inferred_edge — stage 2 reads what stage 1 wrote; the edge is derived
  declared_edge — the same order, stated explicitly with ``deps=``

Concepts introduced:
  - pl.at(...) as tid — binding a region's TaskId
  - deps=[tid] — declaring an edge the inference cannot reach
  - Automatic and explicit edges compose (the wait set is their union)

Run:  python examples/intermediate/07_task_graph.py
Next: examples/advanced/03_mixed_kernel.py
